Final Project
-The player must collect cans while not getting caught by the police; the more beers collected the more blurry the screen becomes.
-You run the exicutable in command line; Move the hero by using W and S; A and D to rotate the hero.
-Type make into the command line to compile the code.
-There is a small bug with the trees if you move the camera in a certian way.
-We do not have a file that is read in as input
-Billy: Billboarding, git conflicts, implementing textures, and rope physics   Amelia: Lights, FragementBuffer, and finding textures   Coleman: Cart heirarchy, fixed police rotation, and made sure the program worked on different platforms (lab and personal Apple computer)
-32 man hours to complete the project.
-8 there were some specific things that were not in the lab that were challenging.
